## Introduction
This project is the eighteenth coding module challenge that we had to complete as part of the Denver University AI Bootcamp coursework. 

The initial code provided for the challenge had us work with a CSV file that included metadata / features for college students that had taken out a loan while completing their education. The task was to build out a recommendation engine using neural network that would be trained on this rich meta data. The neural network model was built, complied, and made predictions if a new student should qualify for a loan or not. 


## Installation Requirements
*Requirements*: You must run Python 3.12.7 to execute the code as the code uses match case sytax that is older versions of python will not recognize.

## Usage
For those trying to understand how to train, and build a recommendation engine (w/ neural network).

## License
I've included the MIT License to encourage collaboration and use by the community.

## Acknowledgement / Contributing
Thank to the guidance of the Denver University AI Bootcamp Teachers Assistant's and their hints via comments that helped me complete this assignment. Without this I would've been completely lost. 

While a section of this code was written by the Denver University AI Bootcamp Teachers Assistant, it has been modified / completed by me.
